    <h2>What is hurricane?</h2>
    <p>A hurricane is a powerful storm that forms over warm ocean waters. It has strong winds that spin in a circle, with speeds of at least 74 mph. A weaker version of this storm, called a tropical storm, has winds between 39 and 73 mph. Both hurricanes and tropical storms usually bring heavy rain and thunderstorms.</p>
    <p>Hurricanes are grouped into five categories based on how strong their winds are and how much damage they can cause:</p>
    <h3>Category One:Winds between 74-95 mph</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Winds can cause some damage</li>
        <li>Minor damage to home exteriors</li>
        <li>Tree branches may break, and smaller trees could be uprooted</li>
        <li>Power lines may be damaged, leading to power outages</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Category Two: Winds between 96-110 mph</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Winds are very dangerous and can cause more serious damage</li>
        <li> Major damage to home exteriors</li>
        <li>Small trees may be uprooted, blocking many roads</li>
        <li>Power outages can last for several days to weeks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Category Three:Winds between 111-129 mph</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These winds cause severe damage</li>
        <li>Homes may suffer extensive exterior damage</li>
        <li>Many trees will be uprooted, and roads will be blocked</li>
        <li>Water and electricity may be hard to get</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Category Four:Winds between 130-156 mph</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These winds cause catastrophic damage</li>    
        <li> Power outages can last for weeks or even months</li>
        <li>Roofs and walls of homes may be torn off</li>
        <li>Most trees will be uprooted, and power lines will be down</li>
        <li>Roads may be blocked, isolating areas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Category Five:Winds over 157 mph</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>These are the most destructive winds</li>   
        <li>Many places might become uninhabitable</li>
        <li>A large number of homes may be destroyed</li>
        <li>Fallen trees and power lines can make areas hard to reach</li>
        <li>Power outages can last for weeks or months</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparedness for Hurricanes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be informed by receiving alerts, warnings, and public safety information before, during, and after emergencies.</li>
        <li>If you live or work in a flood zone, hurricane evacuation zone, or an area that is prone to flooding, you should be prepared to evacuate.</li>
        <li>Ensure your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working and have fresh batteries.</li>
        <li>Consider purchasing a generator to provide power during an outage. </li>
        <li>Avoid driving or going outdoors during a storm. Flooding and damaging winds can make traveling dangerous. </li>
        <li>Continue to monitor media for emergency information.</li>
        <li>If told to shelter in place:
            <ul>
                <li>Stay indoors and away from windows.</li>
                <li>Listen to local television or radio for updates.</li>
                <li>Conditions may change quickly; be prepared to evacuate to a shelter or neighborâ€™s home if necessary.</li>
            </ul></li>
